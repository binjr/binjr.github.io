That view then constantly evolves as users add or remove series from different sources, while navigating through it by changing the time range, the type of chart visualization and smaller aspects such as the color or transparency for each series. Users can navigate the change history for these views, using \u201cback\u201d and \u201cforward\u201d like in a web browser, and save the current state of their session at any time to a file, in order to reopen it later or to share it with someone else.</p> <p>binjr also possesses the ability to visualize time series not only as charts of numeric values, but can be customized to  support visualization for any data type; for instance it features out-of-the-box a source adapter for text based log files.   </p> <p>Log files, produced by applications to trace their lifecycle at runtime, typically contain timestamps for each event they contain; so we can think of them as time series, but with data points being textual information instead of numerical  values. In practical terms, this means that a lot of the features built into binjr to compose and navigate time series visualizations can be applied to log files with great benefits.</p> <p>Behind the scene, binjr uses Apache Lucene to index data from log files; meaning users can use its powerful query  language to hack through vast quantities logged events. It also allows binjr to open log files of any size; unlike most text editors which will fail to load multi gigabytes-sized files as they try to fit it all in memory, binjr will happily index those and present a paginated view so  that memory usage remains reasonable, while the backing index ensures that searches are fast and navigation snappy.</p> <p>With these abilities, binjr aims to become the missing link between text editors and command line tools traditionally used to analyse monitoring data locally and full-blown log analytics platforms (e.g. Elastic/Logstash/Kibana stack) that centralizes logs for entire organizations. It provides many of the same powerful visualization and search features while still remaining a totally local solution (the data never needs to be pushed to the cloud - or anywhere else for that matter), and requiring no setup nor maintenance to speak of.</p>"},{"location":"about/what_is_binjr/#and-what-it-isnt","title":"\u2026and what it isn\u2019t!","text":"<ul> <li>binjr\u00a0is not a system performance collector, nor a collector of anything else for that matter.

To quote Wikipedia:</p> <p>JDK Flight Recorder is an event recorder built into the OpenJDK Java virtual machine. It can be thought of as the software equivalent of a Data Flight Recorder (Black Box) in a commercial aircraft. It captures information about the JVM itself, and the application running in the JVM. There is a wide variety of data captured, for example method profiling, allocation profiling and garbage collection related events. The technology was open sourced in 2018. Analysis and visualization of flight recordings are normally done using JDK Mission Control (JMC).</p> <p>Every single event recorded by JFR naturally includes a timestamp, making it a pretty straight-forward source of data for binjr, one that can certainly benefit for the freeform navigation and dynamic view composition binjr allows.</p>","tags":["JFR","Adapter"]},{"location":"blog/2023/08/new-data-adapter-jdk-flight-recorder/#binjr-is-not-a-jmc-replacement","title":"Binjr  Is Not a JMC Replacement","text":"<p>At least not for the time being; the initial plan is to play on the strength of the app and bring what it does well (browsing trough time series) to JFR recordings, not try to achieve feature parity with JMC, nor make binjr a fully-fledged profiler.</p> <p>Later down the line, we will probably consider adding some new visualization type, more specifically oriented to data types contained in JFR recordings, when those make sense and mix well with the other existing one, and more generally speaking, work well within the time-based navigation paradigm in binjr.</p> <p>For example, the idea of a flame-graph representation for method profiling data that can be refined on selecting the events in specific period on a time line sounds quite promising and would be a naturally fit for binjr\u2019s navigation\u2019s style (and AFAIK, not something that is easily done in JMC at the moment).</p>","tags":["JFR","Adapter"]},{"location":"blog/2023/08/new-data-adapter-jdk-flight-recorder/#whats-in-the-box","title":"What\u2019s in the box?","text":"<p>But this is The Future\u2122 (maybe\u2026), not what we have right-now.

It can even use different horizontal and vertical scaling factors, i.e. scale an application\u2019s width to 125% and its height\u2019s  to 150%, without the result being a blurry mess!</p> <p>And because this scaling doesn\u2019t rely on the underlying operating system\u2019s graphical interface, it works even on platforms that don\u2019t support support this natively.</p> <p>But since JavaFX\u2019s scaling is entirely independent from the environment it runs on, this means the framework has to be able to retrieve the underlying platform-wide scaling factor and apply it internally by default in order to make users\u2019 life simple. It usually does a good job at this, but it can sometime be a bit problematic.</p> <p>Fist of all, there are some cases where detecting the scale factor automatically just doesn\u2019t work well: on Windows or macOS, this is generally not an issue, but on Linux is can be tricky. For instance, JavaFX will attempt to retrieve that info from configuration files typically used by GNOME, which can leaves users of other desktop environments out of luck. And while it\u2019s always possible for savvy users to add the right bits of configuration to their desktop to workaround the issue (i.e. set <code>org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor</code> or export <code>GDK_SCALE</code>), the results can sometimes be unsatisfactory, for example forcing GNOME\u2019s lack of support for fractional scale factors onto KDE, which does support those.</p> <p>And of course, regardless of the environment, there can always be cases where a user might want to use a different scale for their binjr window than for the rest of their desktop.</p> <p>For these reasons, the next release of binjr will propose a new set of settings where users can decide to override the default scale factor automatically detected by the framework, be it because that default value was wrong, or because they\u2019d just like something different, for a change.</p> <p>Right now, I\u2019ve opted to propose a closed list of settings, ranging from 50 to 350 percents, by 25% intervals. We also only propose square ratios (i.e. identical horizontal and vertical values). This feels like a good compromise in exposing some of the possibilities enabled by JavaFX while keeping the list of available choice reasonably short.  </p> <p></p> <p>With that said, this is still a work-in-progress, so feel free to chime in if you\u2019d like to propose something else.</p> <p>Please note that this option is unfortunately not available on macOS, since apparently JavaFX lacks a way to override the detect scaling factor on this platform. Although, as mentioned earlier, the automatic detection is usually flawless on macOS, it is this still a bit disappointing, as scaling an app\u2019s window independently from the rest of the desktop could always prove useful (unless the OS itself already has this built-in?

While everything is in place on our end and aarch64 OpenJDK builds for Windows are available right now, that is sadly not yet the case for JavaFX, binjr\u2019s only other arch-specific dependency.</p> <p>Of course, if you\u2019re running Intel or AMD based machines, do not worry: x86_64 builds are not going anywhere!</p> <p>I know it\u2019s been a long time coming, and as a matter of fact, it has been possible for users to build from source and run binjr on ARM-based macOS and Linux themselves for over three years now! So why has it taken so long for us to add prebuilt binaries to our download page? Quite simply, because of the lack of option for ARM-based runners on Azure Pipelines, the Continuous Integration platform that binjr\u2019s uses to produce the binary builds for download. While GitHub had been offering macOS and Linux aarch64 runners for FOSS projects for a while, and since both platforms are owned by Microsoft, I thought it reasonable to hope that the Azure CI would start doing the same sooner or later. Well\u2026 It\u2019s now been years and given that there are no signs things are about to change any time soon, I have finally decided to bite the bullet and migrate the build logic from Azure Pipelines to GitHub Actions.</p> <p>This is not the first time I have done something like that, far from it. Originally, there weren\u2019t any one single CI platform that provided  hosted builder VMs for all three OSes that binjr targets\u2014even without factoring different CPU architectures into the equation. So I had to write the complex build and release logic a first time for Travis, that took care of Linux and macOS builds, and a second time for AppVeyor, to make Windows binaries. And then somehow orchestrate both to be triggered from a single GitHub release\u2026</p> <p>The fundamental concepts were rigorously the same between Travis and AppVeyor, and their APIs and configuration syntax had a lot in common, so you\u2019d be forgiven to think that once you had one working, getting the other up and running would be a piece of cake. Well, as usual the Devil\u2019s in the details and it\u2019s the slight differences amongst the mass of identical things that made this particular task such a slog. The choice of YAML as a vessel for their configuration DSL (or lack thereof, rather) made this all the more painful, with it\u2019s inherent lack of discoverability, wonky validation tooling and frankly baffling syntax idiosyncrasies. But I eventually got all that working reasonably well, and moved on.</p> <p>A few years down the line, well before GitHub Actions even existed, Microsoft started Azure Pipelines, which offered the ability to run on all three OSes (Windows, mac and Linux) from a single set of build jobs, at no cost for FOSS projects. This sounded like the perfect opportunity to get rid of the quirks induced by having to carefully orchestrate two completely separate build platforms to create a single release. Sure, having to rewrite all that YAML was going to suck, but \u201chey\u201d, I thought to myself, \u201cthis one finally does everything I need, so at least it\u2019ll be the last time I have to deal with any of that!\u201d. Famous last words\u2026 and very dumb ones at that.</p> <p>Anyway, five years on and here we are again. I have written yet another True Final Form for that damn build code.The last one! Until next time, at least.</p> <p></p>","tags":["aarch64","macOS"]},{"location":"blog/2025/06/binjr-has-a-new-home-on-the-fediverse/","title":"binjr has a new home on the Fediverse!","text":"<p>The social account for binjr on the Fediverse is now hosted on its own dedicated server: https://social.binjr.eu/@binjr</p> <p>This means we are now completely independent from any third party for this and most importantly that I am the one who gets to decide the maximum post length now!! \\o/</p> <p>If you were already following the old <code>@binjr@fosstodon.org</code> account, there\u2019s nothing for you to do: you should have automatically been added as a follower to the new account, and stopped following the old one.</p> <p>Shout out to the great folks at https://gotosocial.org/ for making this so easy with their incredibly lightweight Fedi server.
